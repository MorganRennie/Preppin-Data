-- Inputs
-- 1. The same transactions file as the first week's 

SELECT * FROM 
TIL_PLAYGROUND.PREPPIN_DATA_INPUTS.PD2023_WK01;

-- 2. Quarterly Targets dataset
SELECT *
FROM TIL_PLAYGROUND.PREPPIN_DATA_INPUTS.PD2023_WK03_TARGETS;

/*
-- Requirements
- Input the data
- For the transactions file:
    - Filter the transactions to just look at DSB (help)
        - These will be transactions that contain DSB in the Transaction Code field
    - Rename the values in the Online or In-person field, Online of the 1 values and In-Person for the 2 values
    - Change the date to be the quarter (help)
    - Sum the transaction values for each quarter and for each Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person) (help)
- For the targets file:
    - Pivot the quarterly targets so we have a row for each Type of Transaction and each Quarter (help)
    - Rename the fields
    - Remove the 'Q' from the quarter field and make the data type numeric (help)
- Join the two datasets together (help)
    - You may need more than one join clause!
- Remove unnecessary fields
- Calculate the Variance to Target for each row (help)
- Output the data
