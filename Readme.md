## :a: About 

During my time with The Information Lab, I am looking to build a repository of my SQL Solutions to Problems in the Datasphere. Follow me along for the journey!

[Preppin' Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) is a weekly data prep challenge built around [Tableau Prep](https://www.tableau.com/en-gb/products/prep) but the challenges apply to other tools and even coding languages, so ideal practice if you're looking to improve your data prep skills.
